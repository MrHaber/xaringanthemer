# xaringanthemer 0.3.0

* Renamed all xaringanthemer functions that create CSS styles to use the
  prefix "`style_`". For example, `mono_light()` is now `style_mono_light()`.
  Additionally, `write_xaringan_theme()` is now `style_xaringan()` and
  `write_extra_css()` is `style_extra_css()`. Overall, this change makes the
  xarignanthemer API much cleaner and easier to navigate. Previous function
  names are deprecated but still work.

* Added `background_header_auto` parameter that adds a background under the
  first `h1` element (i.e. `# Slide Title`) on a slide. When enabled, the
  background is added automatically to slides, as long as they aren't
  `inverse`, `center`, `middle`, or `bottom`-styled slides. When disabled,
  you can still enable slide title headers by adding the `header_background`
  class to a slide. (thanks, @Btibert3, #10)
  
* The underlying template now uses the `whisker` package.
